# SpaceX Falcon-9 Success Landing Prediction

In this capstone, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

## 1. Data Collection
Collecting the correct format of the dataset from an API.

## 2. Web Scrapping
Performing web scraping to collect Falcon 9 historical launch records from a Wikipedia page titled List of Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches

## 3. Data Wrangling
Perform exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to find some patterns in the data and determine what would be the label for training supervised models.

## 4. Implementing SQL
Load the dataset into the corresponding table in a Db2 database
Execute SQL queries to answer questions

## 5. Data Visualization
Performs Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering.
Visualized the SpaceX launch dataset using Matplotlib and Seaborn and discovered some preliminary correlations between the launch site and success rates.

## 6. Launch Sites Locations Analysis
Performing more interactive visual analytics using Folium
Finding geographical patterns about launch sites.

## 7. Build an Interactive Dashboard with Ploty Dash
Build and publish a dashboard to visualize landing data interactively.

## 8. Machine Learning Prediction
Creates a machine learning pipeline to predict if the first stage will land given the data from the preceding labs.
create a machine learning pipeline to predict if the first stage will land.
Find the best Hyperparameter for kNN, SVM, Classification Trees, and Logistic Regression.
